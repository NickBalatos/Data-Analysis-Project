# Software-Engineering: üíØ

Streamlit Application using Python:

This project focuses on building a web-based application for data mining and analysis, leveraging either Streamlit or RShiny. Key features include tabular data loading, structured representation, 2D visualization, machine learning algorithm comparison, comprehensive result analysis, and project information. Also, this project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for in-depth data exploration and algorithm evaluation, catering to a wide audience.

Key words: Data Mining, Data Analysis, 2D Visualization, Machine Learning

## Installation: üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

### Option 1: Pull the Docker Image

1. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:

    `docker pull spyridonkokotos/brigade-01-sw:latest`

2. Run the Docker container:

    `docker run -d --name brigade-01-sw -p 8501:8501 brigade-01-sw:latest`

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the application.

### Option 2: Build the Dockerfile Locally

1. Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/Brigade-01/Software-Engineering.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
 
    `cd Software-Engineering/src/`

3. Build the Docker image:
  
    `docker build -t brigade-01-sw:latest .`
  
4. Run the Docker container:

    `docker run -d --name brigade-01-sw -p 8501:8501 brigade-01-sw:latest`

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the application.

## Basic Usage: üìà

1. Upload your file: Select the .csv or .xls file you want to use by clicking the <i>"Browse Files"</i> button.

2. Wait for confirmation: Wait until a message confirming the <b>successful</b> upload of your file appears.

3. Start exploring: Once the file is loaded and there are no issues with it's content, you can start exploring the application.

4. Navigate through the app: Use the menu on the left to switch between tabs and utilize the included algorithms to test their performance.

By following these steps, you can efficiently use the application for data analysis and algorithm comparison.

## Reporting Bugs üêû
